🎀 Digital Birthday Diary — 1st Year Celebration

The Digital Birthday Diary is a heartfelt, interactive memory book designed to celebrate and preserve the precious moments of a child's first year of life.
This project captures more than photos — it stores emotions, milestones, laughter, and the unforgettable journey of growth from Day 1 to Year 1.

Designed as a modern digital keepsake, the diary allows loved ones to relive beautiful memories and feel the joy of watching her world unfold.
